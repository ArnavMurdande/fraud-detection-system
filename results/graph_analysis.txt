MODEL INTEGRATION NOTES:
Graph-based features (e.g., 'connected_frauds', 'device_user_degree') 
provide relational context that tabular models often miss.
Strategy:
1. Compute graph features (e.g. PageRank, Community ID) in Neo4j.
2. Export these features to the CSV.
3. Retrain XGBoost with these new 'Risk' columns.
This creates a feedback loop: ML detects pattern -> Graph connects entities -> Stronger ML features.
